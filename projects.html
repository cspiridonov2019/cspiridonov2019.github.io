        <h3>Scribe</h3>
        <p> <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=18JXby0BHmW5i2QzmY6Yxf7fAW2XaWCZC" target="_blank">This folder</a> contains articles I have written for the Francis Parker school magazine <em>The Scribe</em>. I just joined <em>The Scribe</em>
          this year, so there are only two articles currently, but when our third issue goes to print, I will update the folder. My first article was in our Features section and released on Halloween. I was then promoted to co-editor
          of the Editorials section for our second issue, where I wrote a satire about recent news on our campus.</p>

          <h3>Hackathon</h3>
          <p>In last year's Hackathon, we earned 2nd place with our California governorship simulator, linked <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Dc8zyVw4qJAVi0piyONW8nXWbja1f-2L" target="_blank">here</a> as a Google Drive folder.</p>
          <p>In this year's Hackathon (Dec 15), we made a rhythm game that interpreted user-selected songs to create obstacles for the player. (linked <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f4NHgbPdP0XTXRmfAun4IuVwgyx4xmp-?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a> as a Google Drive folder) The original project was in Python, but the graphics library we used wasn't able to facilitate what we envisioned for the game, so we started over in JavaScript and have been working on it since. (linked <a href="https://github.com/dice-club/Pulse" target="_blank">here</a> on GitHub)</p>

          <h3>DICE Club</h3>
          <p>Our <a href="https://colinspiri.github.io" target="_blank">DICE Club Website</a> contains information on the club's mission, members, and projects. I created this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, languages I learned this year in
            my Advanced Programming class. (This website is also made in HTML and CSS)</p>
            <p>We also created an automatic Twitter bot in Python that tweets out random daily statistics from the World Bank, embedded <a href="#twitter">below</a>. Funnily enough, this code is currently running on one of our friends' Raspberry Pis
              that we won at last year's Hackathon.</p>
              <p>DICE Club's most beloved project is our daily newsletter made in Python. It emails our members every day and:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>chooses a random date, time, and place (from a database of reasonable options) for our next club meeting every Saturday</li>
                <li>exerpts from a random probability-related Wikipedia article</li>
                <li>tells a randomly generated joke (the most absurd)</li>
                <li>recognizes a random member as a "Member of Great Quality and Excellence"</li>
                <li>prints our school's lunch option for the day</li>
                <li>includes a random probability-related quote in the post-script</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Unfortunately, though, we haven't uploaded the project to GitHub yet because files in the project contain the email and password to some of our email accounts, and we are researching how to encrypt those files.</p>
